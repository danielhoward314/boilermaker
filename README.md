MoodTrkr allows users to compose journal entries, track sentiment analysis metrics and gain insights from data visualizations. 

The MVP will have the following views: user login/signup, compose, find, analyze, visualize. 

There will be the following models: users, entries, and metrics. 
    Entry belongs to user.
    Analysis belongs to entry. 

For data visualization, I use Keen. 

For sentiment analysis, I use Aylien. 

Front-end components will come from Wired.
